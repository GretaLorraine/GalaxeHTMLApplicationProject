		<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
			and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse
			was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using
			it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its
			head. "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only, as
			it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind." The table was a large one,
			but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: "No
			room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. "There's
			plenty of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large
			arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>
